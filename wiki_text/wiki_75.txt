Title: Diffeomorphism
In mathematics, a diffeomorphism is an isomorphism of differentiable manifolds. It is an invertible function that maps one differentiable manifold to another such that both the function and its inverse are continuously differentiable.
Definition.
Given two differentiable manifolds formula_1 and formula_2, a differentiable map formula_3 is a diffeomorphism if it is a bijection and its inverse formula_4 is differentiable as well. If these functions are formula_5 times continuously differentiable, formula_6 is called a formula_7-diffeomorphism.
Two manifolds formula_1 and formula_2 are diffeomorphic (usually denoted formula_10) if there is a diffeomorphism formula_6 from formula_1 to formula_2. Two formula_7-differentiable manifolds are formula_7-diffeomorphic if there is an formula_16 times continuously differentiable bijective map between them whose inverse is also formula_5 times continuously differentiable.
Diffeomorphisms of subsets of manifolds.
Given a subset formula_18 of a manifold formula_1 and a subset formula_20 of a manifold formula_2, a function formula_22 is said to be smooth if for all formula_23 in formula_18 there is a neighborhood formula_25 of formula_23 and a smooth function formula_27 such that the restrictions agree: formula_28 (note that formula_29 is an extension of formula_6). The function formula_6 is said to be a diffeomorphism if it is bijective, smooth and its inverse is smooth.
Local description.
Testing whether a differentiable map is a diffeomorphism can be made locally under some mild restrictions. This is the Hadamard-Caccioppoli theorem:
If formula_32, formula_33 are connected open subsets of formula_34 such that formula_33 is simply connected, a differentiable map formula_36 is a diffeomorphism if it is proper and if the differential formula_37 is bijective (and hence a linear isomorphism) at each point formula_38 in formula_32.
Some remarks:
It is essential for formula_33 to be simply connected for the function formula_6 to be globally invertible (under the sole condition that its derivative be a bijective map at each point). For example, consider the "realification" of the complex square function 
Then formula_6 is surjective and it satisfies 
Thus, though formula_45 is bijective at each point, formula_6 is not invertible because it fails to be injective (e.g. formula_47).
Since the differential at a point (for a differentiable function) 
is a linear map, it has a well-defined inverse if and only if formula_45 is a bijection. The matrix representation of formula_45 is the formula_51 matrix of first-order partial derivatives whose entry in the formula_52-th row and formula_53-th column is formula_54. This so-called Jacobian matrix is often used for explicit computations.
Diffeomorphisms are necessarily between manifolds of the same dimension. Imagine formula_6 going from dimension formula_56 to dimension formula_57. If formula_58 then formula_45 could never be surjective, and if formula_60 then formula_45 could never be injective. In both cases, therefore, formula_45 fails to be a bijection.
If formula_45 is a bijection at formula_38 then formula_6 is said to be a local diffeomorphism (since, by continuity, formula_66 will also be bijective for all formula_67 sufficiently close to formula_38).
Given a smooth map from dimension formula_56 to dimension formula_57, if formula_71 (or, locally, formula_45) is surjective, formula_6 is said to be a submersion (or, locally, a "local submersion"); and if formula_71 (or, locally, formula_45) is injective, formula_6 is said to be an immersion (or, locally, a "local immersion").
A differentiable bijection is "not" necessarily a diffeomorphism. formula_77, for example, is not a diffeomorphism from formula_78 to itself because its derivative vanishes at 0 (and hence its inverse is not differentiable at 0). This is an example of a homeomorphism that is not a diffeomorphism.

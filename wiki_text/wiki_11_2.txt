Title: Common ostrich
The common ostrich (Struthio camelus), or simply ostrich, is a species of flightless bird native to certain large areas of Africa. It is one of two extant species of ostriches, the only living members of the genus "Struthio" in the ratite order of birds. The other is the Somali ostrich ("Struthio molybdophanes"), which was recognized as a distinct species by BirdLife International in 2014 having been previously considered a distinctive subspecies of ostrich.
The common ostrich belongs to the order Struthioniformes. Struthioniformes previously contained all the ratites, such as the kiwis, emus, rheas, and cassowaries. However, recent genetic analysis has found that the group is not monophyletic, as it is paraphyletic with respect to the tinamous, so the ostriches are now classified as the only members of the order. Phylogenetic studies have shown that it is the sister group to all other members of Palaeognathae and thus the flighted tinamous are the sister group to the extinct moa. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs, and can run for a long time at a speed of with short bursts up to about , the fastest land speed of any bird. The common ostrich is the largest living species of bird and largest living dinosaur. It lays [[Ostrich egg|the largest eggs] of any living bird (the extinct giant elephant bird ("Aepyornis maximus") of [[Madagascar]] and the south island giant moa ("Dinornis robustus") of New Zealand laid larger eggs). Ostriches are the most dangeorus birds on the planet, with an average of two to three deaths being recorded each year in [[South Africa]].
The common ostrich's diet consists mainly of plant matter, though it also eats [[invertebrate]]s and small reptiles. It lives in nomadic groups of 5 to 50 birds. When threatened, the ostrich will either hide itself by lying flat against the ground or run away. If cornered, it can attack with a kick of its powerful legs. Mating patterns differ by geographical region, but territorial males fight for a harem of two to seven females.
The common ostrich is [[farming|farmed]] around the world, particularly for its feathers, which are decorative and are also used as [[feather duster]]s. Its skin is used for [[Ostrich leather|leather]] products and its meat is marketed commercially, with its leanness a common marketing point.
Description.
The common ostrich is the largest and heaviest living bird. Males stand tall and weigh , whereas females are about tall and weigh . While exceptional male ostriches (in the nominate subspecies) can weigh up to , some specimens in South Africa can only weigh between . New chicks are [[wiktionary:fawn|fawn]] in color, with dark brown spots. After three months they start to gain their juvenile plumage, which is steadily replaced by adult-like plumage during their second year. At four or five months old, they are already about half the size of an adult bird, and after a year they reach adult height, but not till they are 18 months old will they be fully as heavy as their parents.
The feathers of adult males are mostly black, with white [[flight feathers#Primaries|primaries]] and a white tail. However, the tail of one subspecies is buff. Females and young males are grayish-brown and white. The head and neck of both male and female ostriches are nearly bare, with a thin layer of [[Down feather|down]]. The skin of the female's neck and thighs is pinkish gray, while the male's is gray or pink dependent on subspecies.
The long neck and legs keep their head up to above the ground, and their eyes are said to be the largest of any land vertebrate in diameter helping them to see predators at a great distance. The eyes are shaded from sunlight from above. However, the head and [[Beak|bill]] are relatively small for the birds' huge size, with the bill measuring .
Their skin varies in color depending on the subspecies, with some having light or dark gray skin and others having pinkish or even reddish skin. The strong legs of the common ostrich are unfeathered and show bare skin, with the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] (the lowest upright part of the leg) being covered in scales: red in the male, black in the female. The [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] of the common ostrich is the largest of any living bird, measuring in length. The bird is [[didactyl]], having just two toes on each [[Bird feet and legs|foot]] (most birds have four), with the [[nail (anatomy)|nail]] on the larger, inner toe resembling a [[hoof]]. The outer toe has no nail. The reduced number of toes is an adaptation that appears to aid in running, useful for getting away from predators. Common ostriches can run at a speed over and can cover in a single stride. The wings reach a span of about , and the [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord]] measurement of is around the same size as for the largest flying birds.
The feathers lack the tiny hooks that lock together the smooth external feathers of flying birds, and so are soft and fluffy and serve as insulation. Common ostriches can tolerate a wide range of temperatures. In much of their habitat, temperatures vary as much as between night and day. Their temperature control relies in part on behavioral thermoregulation. For example, they use their wings to cover the naked skin of the upper legs and flanks to conserve heat, or leave these areas bare to release heat. The wings also function as stabilizers to give better maneuverability when running. Tests have shown that the wings are actively involved in rapid braking, turning, and zigzag maneuvers. They have 50–60 tail feathers, and their wings have 16 primary, four [[alular]], and 20–23 secondary feathers.
The common ostrich's [[sternum]] is flat, lacking the [[Keel (bird)|keel]] to which wing muscles attach in flying birds. The [[beak]] is flat and broad, with a rounded tip. Like all [[ratites]], the ostrich has no [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]], and it also lacks a [[gallbladder]] and the [[caecum]] is . Unlike all other living birds, the common ostrich secretes urine separately from feces. All other birds store the urine and feces combined in the [[coprodeum]], but the ostrich stores the feces in the terminal rectum. They also have unique [[pubic bones]] that are fused to hold their gut. Unlike most birds, the males have a [[Intromittent organ#Birds|copulatory organ]], which is retractable and long. Their [[palate]] differs from other ratites in that the [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] and [[palatal]] bones are unconnected.
Taxonomy.
The common ostrich was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] from Sweden in his 18th-century work, "[[Systema Naturae]]" under its current [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]]. Its [[genus]] is derived from the [[Late Latin]] "struthio" meaning "ostrich". The specific name is an allusion to "strouthokamelos" the [[Ancient Greek]] name for the ostrich, meaning camel-sparrow, the "camel" term referring to its dry habitat. Στρουθοκάμηλος is still the modern Greek name for the ostrich.
The common ostrich belongs to the Infraclass "[[Palaeognathae]]" commonly known as 
[[ratites]]. Other members include [[rhea (bird)|rheas]], [[emu]]s, [[cassowary|cassowaries]], [[moa]], [[Kiwi (bird)|kiwi]], [[elephant birds]], [[tinamous]]. 
Subspecies.
Four [[subspecies]] are recognized:
Some analyses indicate that the Somali ostrich is now considered a full species; the [[Tree of Life Web Project|Tree of Life Project]], "[[The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World]]", [[BirdLife International]], and the [[Birds of the World: Recommended English Names|IOC World Bird List]] recognize it as a different species. A few authorities, including the "[[Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World]]", do not recognize it as separate. [[Mitochondrial DNA]] [[haplotype]] comparisons suggest that it diverged from the other ostriches not quite 4 [[mya (unit)|mya]] due to formation of the [[East African Rift]]. Hybridization with the subspecies that evolved southwestwards of its range, "S. c. massaicus", has apparently been prevented from occurring on a significant scale by ecological separation; the Somali ostrich prefers bushland where it browses middle-height vegetation for food while the Masai ostrich is, like the other subspecies, a [[grazing]] bird of the open [[savanna]] and "[[miombo]]" habitat.
The population from [[Río de Oro]] was once separated as "Struthio camelus spatzi" because its eggshell pores were shaped like a teardrop and not round. As there is considerable variation of this character and there were no other differences between these birds and adjacent populations of "S. c. camelus", the separation is no longer considered valid. However, a study analysing the postcranial skeleton of all living and recently extinct species and subspecies of ostriches appeared to validate "S. c. spatzi" based on its unique skeletal proportions. This population disappeared in the latter half of the 20th century. There were 19th-century reports of the existence of small ostriches in North Africa; these are referred to as Levaillant's ostrich ("Struthio bidactylus") but remain a hypothetical form not supported by material evidence.

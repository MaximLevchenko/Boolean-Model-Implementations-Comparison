Title: Politics of Qatar
The political system of Qatar runs under an authoritarian semi-constitutional monarchy with the emir as head of state and chief executive, and the prime minister as the head of government. Under the Constitution of Qatar, the partially elected Consultative Assembly has limited scope for rejecting legislation or dismissing ministers. The second general election was held in 2021. Political parties are banned and all candidates must run as independents.
The current hereditary emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, runs the country in an autocratic manner, holds nearly all executive and legislative authority, and controls the judiciary. He appoints the prime minister and cabinet. According to Freedom House, political rights in Qatar are severely limited. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices in 2023, Qatar is the 6th least electoral democratic country in the world and second least electoral democratic country in the Middle East. 
Legal system.
Sharia law is a main source of Qatari legislation according to Qatar's constitution. Sharia, derived from the Arabic term meaning 'the path to follow,' constitutes a divine revelation conveyed by God to the Prophet Muhammad, the eminent figure in the establishment of Islam, during the year AD 570. Consequently, Sharia embodies a religious framework characterized by its origins and regulations. This legal system, seemingly unidirectional, emanates from God to the individual. The Islamic Sharia is regarded as the primary foundation, necessitating the formulation of legislative and judicial frameworks grounded in Islamic legal principles to govern transactions within Qatari law. Sharia law is applied to laws pertaining to family law, inheritance, and several criminal acts (including adultery, robbery and murder). In some cases in Sharia-based family courts, a female's testimony is worth half a man's and in some cases a female witness is not accepted at all. Codified family law was introduced in 2006. In practice, Qatar's legal system is a mixture of civil law and Islamic law.
In 2016, Saudi Instagram star and model King Luxy was arrested in Qatar for allegedly being homosexual. He spent 2 months in custody before he was released. Qatari embassy in turn reported that he was arrested before departing from Qatar's only civilian international airport for various charges having nothing to do with his sexual preference and counter-alleged him for intruding on the privacy of a Qatari citizen.
Stoning is no longer a legal punishment in Qatar, and has never been used. Apostasy is a crime punishable by the death penalty in Qatar. Blasphemy is punishable by up to seven years in prison and proselytizing can be punished by up to 10 years in prison. Homosexuality is a crime punishable in sharia by the death penalty for Muslims, though in Qatar the penalty for consenting males is up to 5 years in prison.
In 2014, Qatar launched a modesty campaign to remind tourists of the modest dress code. Female tourists are advised not to wear leggings, miniskirts, sleeveless dresses and short or tight clothing in public. Men are advised against wearing only shorts and singlets.
As of 2014, certain provisions of the Qatari Criminal Code allow punishments such as flogging and stoning to be imposed as criminal sanctions. The UN Committee Against Torture found that these practices constituted a breach of the obligations imposed by the UN Convention Against Torture. Qatar retains the death penalty, mainly for threats against national security.
Commercial relationships are governed by Qatar's Civil Code.
In the report published by the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on 13 September 2020, it was declared that Article 19 in the International Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that "everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference." Similarly, Article 47 in the Constitution of Qatar stipulates that freedom of expression is guaranteed in accordance with the conditions and circumstances set forth in law.
Alcohol.
Alcohol consumption is partially legal in Qatar, some five-star luxury hotels are allowed to sell alcohol to their non-Muslim customers. Muslims are not allowed to consume alcohol in Qatar and Muslims caught consuming alcohol are liable to flogging or deportation. Non-Muslim expatriates can obtain a permit to purchase alcohol for personal consumption. The Qatar Distribution Company (a subsidiary of Qatar Airways) is permitted to import alcohol and pork; it operates the one and only liquor store in the country, which also sells pork to holders of liquor licences. Qatari officials have also indicated a willingness to allow alcohol in "fan zones" at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
Until recently, restaurants on The Pearl Island (a human-made island near Doha) were allowed to serve alcoholic drinks. In December 2011, however, restaurants on the Pearl were told to stop selling alcohol. No explanation was given for the ban. Speculation about the reason includes the government's desire to project a more pious image in advance of the country's first election of a royal advisory body and rumours of a financial dispute between the government and the resort's developers. Despite the economic consequences of the ban, many believe that it has been a necessary measure in order to ensure the safety and enjoyment of fans at the World Cup. The absence of alcohol has helped to create a more positive and enjoyable atmosphere at the event, with a more family-friendly environment being evident. The lack of alcohol had contributed to a less bawdy atmosphere around the games at the World Cup which led to a safer experience female fans at the tournament
Workers.
In February 2022, The African Regional Organization of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC-Africa) welcomed the recent announcement by the Qatar government to abolish exit permits for migrant workers. ITUC commended Qatari government for the obvious show of genuine commitment towards meeting their pledge made to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to effectively reform their labour laws so as to bring in conformity with ILO Conventions and other international statutes.
Cases of ill-treatment of immigrant labour have been observed. The Nepalese ambassador to Qatar, Maya Kumari Sharma, described the emirate as an "open jail".
Qatar does not have national occupational health standards or guidelines, and workplace injuries are the third highest cause of accidental deaths. In May 2012, Qatari officials declared their intention to allow the establishment of an independent trade union. Qatar also announced it will scrap its sponsor system for foreign labour, which requires that all foreign workers be sponsored by local employers, who in some cases hold workers' passports and can deny them permission to change jobs.
In August 2022, 60 Migrant workers were arrested and deported for protesting against the non-payment by their employer, Al Bandary International Group, a major construction and hospitality firm. Some of the demonstrators were from Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Egypt and the Philippines had not been paid for seven months. According to a report published by France 24, those protesters were detained for breaching public security laws and minority of protesters were deported by the order of court who failed to remain peaceful and breached Qatar’s public security law. Qatar’s labour ministry said it will pay Al Bandary workers and will take further action against the company which was already under investigation for failing to pay wages.

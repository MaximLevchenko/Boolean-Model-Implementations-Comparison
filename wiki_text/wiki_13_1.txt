Title: Geometric series
In mathematics, a geometric series is the sum of an infinite number of terms that have a constant ratio between successive terms. For example, the series
is geometric, because each successive term can be obtained by multiplying the previous term by formula_2. In general, a geometric series is written as formula_3, where formula_4 is the coefficient of each term and formula_5 is the common ratio between adjacent terms. The geometric series had an important role in the early development of calculus, is used throughout mathematics, and can serve as an introduction to frequently used mathematical tools such as the Taylor series, the Fourier series, and the matrix exponential.
The name geometric series indicates each term is the geometric mean of its two neighboring terms, similar to how the name arithmetic series indicates each term is the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring terms.
Components.
Coefficient "a".
The geometric series "a" + "ar" + "ar"2 + "ar"3 + ... is written in expanded form. Every coefficient in the geometric series is the same. In contrast, the power series written as "a"0 + "a"1"r" + "a"2"r"2 + "a"3"r"3 + ... in expanded form has coefficients "a"i that can vary from term to term. In other words, the geometric series is a special case of the power series. The first term of a geometric series in expanded form is the coefficient "a" of that geometric series.
In addition to the expanded form of the geometric series, there is a generator form of the geometric series written as
and a closed form of the geometric series written as
The derivation of the closed form from the expanded form is shown in this article's section. However even without that derivation, the result can be confirmed with long division: "a" divided by (1 - "r") results in "a" + "ar" + "ar"2 + "ar"3 + ... , which is the expanded form of the geometric series.
It is often a convenience in notation to set the series equal to the sum "s" and work with the geometric series
Changing even one of the coefficients to something other than coefficient "a" would change the resulting sum of functions to some function other than "a" / (1 − "r") within the range |"r"| &lt; 1. As an aside, a particularly useful change to the coefficients is defined by the Taylor series, which describes how to change the coefficients so that the sum of functions converges to any user selected, sufficiently smooth function within a range.
Common ratio "r".
The geometric series "a" + "ar" + "ar"2 + "ar"3 + ... is an infinite series defined by just two parameters: coefficient "a" and common ratio "r". Common ratio "r" is the ratio of any term with the previous term in the series. Or equivalently, common ratio "r" is the term multiplier used to calculate the next term in the series. The following table shows several geometric series:
The convergence of the geometric series depends on the value of the common ratio "r":
The rate of convergence also depends on the value of the common ratio "r". Specifically, the rate of convergence gets slower as "r" approaches 1 or −1. For example, the geometric series with "a" = 1 is 1 + "r" + "r"2 + "r"3 + ... and converges to 1 / (1 - "r") when |"r"| &lt; 1. However, the number of terms needed to converge approaches infinity as "r" approaches 1 because "a" / (1 - "r") approaches infinity and each term of the series is less than or equal to one. In contrast, as "r" approaches −1 the sum of the first several terms of the geometric series starts to converge to 1/2 but slightly flips up or down depending on whether the most recently added term has a power of "r" that is even or odd. That flipping behavior near "r" = −1 is illustrated in the adjacent image showing the first 11 terms of the geometric series with "a" = 1 and |"r"| &lt; 1.
The common ratio "r" and the coefficient "a" also define the geometric progression, which is a list of the terms of the geometric series but without the additions. Therefore the geometric series "a" + "ar" + "ar"2 + "ar"3 + ... has the geometric progression (also called the geometric sequence) "a", "ar", "ar"2, "ar"3, ... The geometric progression - as simple as it is - models a surprising number of natural phenomena, 
As an aside, the common ratio "r" can be a complex number such as |"r"|ei"θ" where |"r"| is the vector's magnitude (or length), "θ" is the vector's angle (or orientation) in the complex plane and i2 = -1. With a common ratio |"r"|ei"θ", the expanded form of the geometric series is "a" + "a"|"r"|ei"θ" + "a"|"r"|2ei2"θ" + "a"|"r"|3ei3"θ" + ... Modeling the angle "θ" as linearly increasing over time at the rate of some angular frequency "ω"0 (in other words, making the substitution "θ" = "ω"0"t"), the expanded form of the geometric series becomes "a" + "a"|"r"|ei"ω"0"t" + "a"|"r"|2ei2"ω"0"t" + "a"|"r"|3ei3"ω"0"t" + ... , where the first term is a vector of length "a" not rotating at all, and all the other terms are vectors of different lengths rotating at harmonics of the fundamental angular frequency "ω"0. The constraint |"r"|&lt;1 is enough to coordinate this infinite number of vectors of different lengths all rotating at different speeds into tracing a circle, as shown in the adjacent video. Similar to how the Taylor series describes how to change the coefficients so the series converges to a user selected sufficiently smooth function within a range, the Fourier series describes how to change the coefficients (which can also be complex numbers in order to specify the initial angles of vectors) so the series converges to a user selected periodic function.
Sum.
The sum of the first "n" terms of a geometric series, up to and including the "r" n-1 term, is given by the closed-form formula:
